# MES Reporting

The MES collects valuable data during production. The reporting features allow managers and planners to gain insights into manufacturing performance, identify bottlenecks, and track key metrics.

## Navigating to Reports

<Steps>
  <Step>From the MES module's main page or navigation menu, click on "Reports," "Analytics," or "Dashboards."</Step>
  <Step>This will take you to the main reporting area, which may present several types of reports.</Step>
</Steps>

## Available Reports

The following are common reports available in the MES, based on the V1 specification.

### 1. WIP (Work-In-Progress) Dashboard

<Accordion title="Purpose">
  Provides a real-time overview of current production activity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Use">
  <Steps>
    <Step>Typically the default view in the Reports section or a prominent dashboard.</Step>
    <Step>
      Look for sections showing:
      - **Order Counts by Status**: A summary of how many orders are currently "Pending," "In Progress," "On Hold," and "Completed Today." This gives a quick snapshot of the overall workload and flow.
      - **List of In Progress/On Hold Orders**: A detailed list of orders that are currently active or paused. This list usually shows:
        - Order Number
        - Product being manufactured
        - Quantity
        - Current Work Order Operation (WOO) title
        - Organization (Org) assigned to the current WOO
        - Current status (In Progress or On Hold)
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insights">
  Helps identify if work is piling up in certain statuses, which orders are actively being worked on, and where current holds are occurring.
</Accordion>

### 2. Cycle Time Analysis Report

<Accordion title="Purpose">
  Analyzes how long operations are taking compared to their target times.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Use">
  <Steps>
    <Step>Select this report from the reporting menu.</Step>
    <Step>
      You can typically filter the analysis by:
      - **Date Range**: Focus on operations completed within a specific period.
      - **Routing**: Analyze performance for a specific manufacturing routing or even specific operations within that routing.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      The report usually displays:
      - **Average, Minimum, and Maximum `total_active_time_seconds`**: For each operation (or routing operation definition), it shows the statistical spread of completion times.
      - **Comparison against `target_time_seconds`**: Highlights variances, showing if operations are generally meeting, exceeding, or falling short of their targets. This might be shown as a percentage or absolute difference.
      - Visualizations like bar charts or trend lines might be used.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insights">
  Identify operations that are consistently taking longer than expected, which could be bottlenecks. Also, find operations that are faster than target, which might indicate efficient practices or overly generous targets.
</Accordion>

### 3. Hold/Pause Analysis Report

<Accordion title="Purpose">
  Provides insights into why and for how long operations are being paused.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Use">
  <Steps>
    <Step>Select this report from the reporting menu.</Step>
    <Step>
      Filter by:
      - **Date Range**: Analyze pauses that occurred within a specific period.
      - **Organization (Org)**: Focus on pauses within a particular department or work center.
      - **Pause Reason**: You might be able to filter for specific pause reasons.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      The report typically shows:
      - **Total Time Paused by Reason**: Aggregated duration of all pauses, grouped by each `MES_Pause_Reason.description`. This helps identify which reasons contribute most to downtime.
      - **Frequency of Each Pause Reason**: How many times each pause reason was selected.
      - Charts (e.g., Pareto charts) are often used to visualize the most significant reasons by duration or frequency.
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insights">
  Understand the primary causes of production interruptions. This data is crucial for improvement efforts aimed at reducing downtime (e.g., if "Machine Breakdown" is high, it might point to maintenance issues).
</Accordion>

### 4. Order Schedule Adherence

<Accordion title="Purpose">
  Tracks how well production orders are meeting their planned launch dates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Use">
  <Steps>
    <Step>Select this report or view.</Step>
    <Step>Filter by **Launch Date** ranges (e.g., "Launching Today," "Launching This Week," "Overdue Launch").</Step>
    <Step>The view lists orders and their current status, highlighting those that are overdue for launch but not yet started, or those that started late.</Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insights">
  Helps planners and managers monitor if production is starting on time and identify orders that need attention to prevent further delays.
</Accordion>

### 5. Data Capture Analysis (Potential Report)

<Info>
  The availability and specifics of this report depend on the implementation following the data input refactor.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Purpose">
  To analyze the data collected by operators via the `data_input_schema` fields during operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Use">
  <Steps>
    <Step>If available, this report would allow you to select specific data input fields (e.g., a particular measurement).</Step>
    <Step>You could then see the collected values, potentially with filters for date range, product, or routing.</Step>
    <Step>Basic statistical analysis (mean, median, range) or visualizations (histograms, control charts if SPC features are implemented) might be available.</Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insights">
  Useful for quality control, process monitoring (e.g., are measurements within tolerance?), and identifying trends or anomalies in operator-captured data.
</Accordion>

## Exporting Reports

<Info>
  Some reports may offer an option to export the data (e.g., to CSV or Excel) for further analysis in other tools. Look for "Export" or "Download" buttons.
</Info>

<Check>
  By regularly reviewing these reports, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your manufacturing processes, improve efficiency, and reduce downtime.
