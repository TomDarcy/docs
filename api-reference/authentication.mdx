title: Authentication
---


All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

Only account admins can create and revoke API tokens inside the FactoryPulse UI. The token is tied to the account and the user that created it. One user can have multiple tokens, this is useful if you have multiple integrations and want to keep track of them.

They can create and revoke tokens on API section of their user settings.

Tokens keep track of the time they were last used so users can verify their integrations are working correctly and keep an eye on them.


Authentication with the FactoryPulse API is as simple as passing in the Authorization header.

An example Authorization header would look like the following:

``` json
Pass hello
GET /api/v1/me.json
Authorization: Bearer {exampletoken}
```
If you'd like to authenticate users through the API using their email and password to retrieve an API token, you can make a POST request to the auth endpoint with the user's email and password. This is handy for authenticating from a mobile app, etc.

``` json
POST /api/v1/auth.json
Params: { email: "steve@apple.com", password: "hunter2" }
```

This will return a JSON response with a token you can use to access the API.

``` json
{ token: "abcd1234" }
```
