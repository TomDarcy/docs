<Warning>
Before you start, make sure you have your [org levels](/accounts/org-levels) and [org set up](/accounts/org-setup) so you can assign risk assessments to the right groups.
</Warning>

Managing risk assessments inside FactoryPulse is really simple. On the risk assessments home page you can see all of the risk assessments for your account. By default you will see all approved risk assessments. You can then filter by organisation, or change the view to see draft risk assessments, or those pending approval by yourself.
On the right hand side you can see a chart showing your risk profile for all the risk assessments visible in your current view.

## Creating a new risk assessment
To create a new risk assessment, just click on the "New Risk Assessment" button at the top of the risk assessments page. This will open a page where you can enter the risk assessment details, to get started you only need to enter a title, description of the activity and organisation. The rest of the details can be populated later if you need to. Once you press save on this initial page it will create the draft risk assessment and you can then add individual risks at the bottom of the page. This page will automatically save as you add each risk so there is no need to press save again.

To edit the charter, just click on the edit button at the top of the charter section.

## Approving a risk assessment
To approve a risk assessment, just click on the submit for approval button at the top of the page. This will send the risk assessment to the user specified as the approver in the risk assessment details.

## Updating an approved risk assessment
Once an assessment is approved it is locked to changes to preserve your audit trail, to update an approved assessment you can create a new draft assessment by clicking the upissue button which will create a copy and increment your version number. Old risk assessments are then available in the All view on the main risk assessment page
