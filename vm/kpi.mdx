      alt="KPI manager screenshot"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a KPI">
    Create a KPI to start tracking your data. Ensure you've set the direction of the KPI to either "up" or "down" to indicate if a higher or lower value is better. The frequency the data should be inputted and at what level the data should be inputted. For example, you might collect output shiftly at a cell level, first time pass rate daily at a department level or absence monthly at a factory level.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit a KPI">
    Once created you can edit the KPI by clicking on the edit icon <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="solid" /> in the KPI manager.
    <Info>
      You can't completely delete a KPI, clicking the delete icon <Icon icon="trash" iconType="solid" /> will archive the KPI. Archived KPIs are hidden end users but are visible at the bottom of the KPI manager.
